        Hi, my name is Roo, director of <a href="https://www.keenuk.org">KEEN</a>, an awesome non-profit in the UK. 
        I am lucky to get to work everyday on solving problems and creating things 
         as part of a fantastic team, in a fab community, and with amazing partners and collaborators.
        </p>
        <p>
        Digital plays an increasingly central role in our work, and it is easy to feel out of the loop when you do not understand things, even if just a bit. 
        This 'sandbox' is my attempt to understand more about what our developers do, through learning a bit myself. Hopefully - as a result - 
        I will be in a better position to support them, and truly appreciate their work!
        </p>
