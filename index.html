        Hi, my name is Roo, director of <a href="https://www.keenuk.org">KEEN</a>, an awesome non-profit in the UK. 
        I am lucky enough to work everyday on solving problems and creating things 
         as part of a fantastic team, in a wonderful community, and with inspiring partners and collaborators.
        </p>
        <p>
        Digital plays an increasingly central role in our work, and it is easy to feel out of the loop when you do not understand things! 
        This 'sandbox' is my attempt to understand more about what our developers do, through learning a bit myself. Hopefully - as a result - 
        I will be in a better position to support them, and truly appreciate what they do.
        </p>
